This dashboard provides a structured view of application behavior, customer risk levels, and financial performance, 
helping identify early warning signs and guide informed decision-making.

Key Insights                                                                                                                    
        +  Comparing application volume with total amounts and payments reveals trends and exposes whether financial 
flows align with operational activity.                            
        +  Average Rate and DTI analysis highlights customer solvency and helps detect early indicators of default risk.                                                                                                         
        +  Breakdowns by state, purpose, subgrade, and term uncover which segments are stable and which may require
 additional oversight.

Risk Mitigation
        +Segments with high DTI or low subgrade should be monitored closely to reduce exposure to potential losses. 
        + Significant variation in Loan Status or Verification Status suggests a need to strengthen verification procedures
 and credit assessment.    
        +Irregularities in ID Count Over Time may indicate operational bottlenecks, policy impacts, or seasonal fluctuations.

Recommended Actions 
           +Apply stricter credit rules in segments showing elevated DTI, weaker subgrades, or poor loan performance.
           +Track monthly financial indicators to prevent potential cash-flow decline.
           +Reassess processes in regions or customer groups where approval rates or application quality diverge from the
 norm.
           + Use KPIs as an early alert system and prioritize regular monitoring.
